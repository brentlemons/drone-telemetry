# Drone Telemetry
Arduino code for a homemade drone.

The files in [Ground Control](/Ground%20Control/) are for the arduino connected to the controller. At this point in time I'm not sure how the controller will interface with the arduino so maybe through a computer as well.\
The files in [Telemetry](/Telemetry/) are uploaded to the arduino on the drone itself. I will add what boards and breakout boards one needs as well as pin configuration later, but can't be bothered to look at what we have.
